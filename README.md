# WaterGAP2
Source code for the WaterGAP 2 model family.

Please note that this is not a compilable code and the model is not executable. Unfortunately, we currently do not have the capacity to provide all the input data, the water use models, documentation and user support to enable others to run the model. We started to reprogram the code to enable community development.
