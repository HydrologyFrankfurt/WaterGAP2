* Gamma was changed from 0.3 - 3 (2.1f, 2.1g, 2.1h) to 0.1 - 5 since 2.2 WATCH
*
* A description of the effect of additional discharge measurement stations is
* from Hunger, M., and P. DÃ¶ll (2008), Value of river discharge data for
* global-scale hydrological modeling, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,
* 12(3), 841-861, doi:10.5194/hess-12-841-2008. [online] Available from:
* http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/12/841/2008/
*
* There is also a Word document of the calibration procedure (of 2.1f) written
* by Martin Hunger ("WaterGAP 2.1f Neuerungen, Kalibrierung, Regionalisierung")
* in 2006. A documetation of calibration process of 2.2 refvers is in
* preparation
*
